🌌 About
VEFCHAIN is a revolutionary blockchain project that redefines solving computational problems through the lens of relativity:

"Solving is verification in slow motion."

We introduce the Verification Elevation Factor (VEF) to measure computational effort, and create a new consensus mechanism:
Proof of Verification Elevation (PoVE).

This system rewards structured intelligence — not just computational brute force.

🚀 Features
⚡ VEF Measurement — Dynamic scaling of problem-solving effort

🔗 Blockchain — Full custom blockchain with dynamic rewards

🧠 PoVE Consensus — Reward based on solution structure

🔒 ZK-Proof Ready — zk-compatible for problem verification

🌐 Testnet — Local multi-agent simulation of solvers and verifiers

📊 Streamlit Dashboard — Real-time interaction and visualization

🏛️ Architecture Overview

Layer	Description
