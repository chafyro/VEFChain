🌌 About
VEFCHAIN is a revolutionary blockchain project that redefines solving computational problems through the lens of relativity:

"Solving is verification in slow motion."

We introduce the Verification Elevation Factor (VEF) (VEF) and create a new blockchain consensus:
Proof of Verification Elevation (PoVE).

This system rewards structured intelligence, not brute force.

🚀 Features
⚡ VEF dynamic scaling

🔗 Custom blockchain architecture

🧠 PoVE (Proof of Verification Elevation) consensus

🔒 zk-Proof compatibility

🌐 Local testnet + multi-agent simulation

📊 Live Streamlit dashboard interaction
